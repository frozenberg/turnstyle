#Turnstyle

If you downloaded the turnstyle-no-pods.zip, enter the following command:

    pod install

If you downloaded the zip from Github, you can skip the above step.

 1. Open `Turnstyle.xcworkspace`
 2. Change simulator to iPhone 7 (or your own phone if you want to use the camera)
 3. Create a new event if you want.
 4. Visit the following url on the simulator/phone to see a list of current events and select any one of them to view a ticket[http://mikeclimbs.rocks/tickets/test.html](http://mikeclimbs.rocks/tickets/test.html)
 5. Purchase a ticket using your own credit card(scan or type) or the test card 4242 4242 4242 4242. We have not setup the backend server to complete payments so you will never be charged
 6. If you are the host of the event, you can scan the QR code for any user that has "bought" a ticket
